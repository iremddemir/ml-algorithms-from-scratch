# ML Algorithms from Scratch
This implementations are done for ENGR421 Fall'20. Engr421 is an introductory course to machine learning.

Topics covered are regression, classification, clustering, and dimensionality reduction methods; supervised and unsupervised models; linear and nonlinear models; parametric and nonparametric models; combinations of multiple models; comparisons of multiple models and model selection.

Course focuses on both mathematical background and real life applications of the algorithms.

This repository has solutions to biweekly homeworks which are implemented from scratch.
- HW2: Naive bayes classifier
- HW3: Discrimination by regression is applied with K-sigmoid function
- HW4: Nonparametric Regression
- HW5: Regression using decision tree
- HW6: One vs All Support Vector classification
- HW7: Expectation Maximization clustiring
- HW8: Spectral clustiring
