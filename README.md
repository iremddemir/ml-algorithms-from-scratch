# ENGR 421 Introduction to Machine Learning
This is an introductory course to machine learning.

Topics covered are regression, classification, clustering, and dimensionality reduction methods; supervised and unsupervised models; linear and nonlinear models; parametric and nonparametric models; combinations of multiple models; comparisons of multiple models and model selection.

Course focuses on both mathematical background and real life applications of the algorithms.

This repository has solutions to biweekly homeworks.
